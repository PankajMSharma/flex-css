# flex-css
This can be used to phase out anguar's flex/layout library while migrating to newer version of angular.

# Remove prefix before use
prefix "fl" has been added so that it has no chance of conflicting with other css libraries present in your project. This can be removed easily but just removing parent scss component fl.
